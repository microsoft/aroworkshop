The `rating-api` is a NodeJS application that connects to mongoDB to retrieve and rate items. Below are some of the details that you'll need to deploy this.

- `rating-api` on GitHub: <https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-api>
- The container exposes port 8080
- MongoDB connection is configured using an environment variable called `MONGODB_URI`

### Fork the application to your own GitHub repository

To be able to setup CI/CD webhooks, you'll need to fork the application into your personal GitHub repository.

### Use the OpenShift CLI to deploy the `rating-api`

> **Note** You're going to be using [source-to-image (S2I)](#source-to-image-s2i) as a build strategy.

{% collapsible %}

```sh
oc new-app https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-api --strategy=source --name=rating-api
```

{% endcollapsible %}

### Configure the required environment variables

{% collapsible %}

Create the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable. This URI should look like `mongodb://[username]:[password]@[endpoint]:27017/ratingsdb`. You'll need to replace the `[usernaame]` and `[password]` with the ones you used when creating the database. You'll also need to replace the `[endpoint]` with the hostname acquired in the previous step

Hit **Save** when done.

It can also be done with CLI

```
oc set env deploy/rating-api MONGODB_URI=mongodb://ratingsuser:ratingspassword@mongodb.workshop.svc.cluster.local:27017/ratingsdb
```

{% endcollapsible %}

### Verify that the service is running

{% collapsible %}

If you navigate to the logs of the `rating-api` deployment, you should see a log message confirming the code can successfully connect to the mongoDB.
For that, in the deployment's details screen, click on *Pods* tab, then on one of the pods

{% endcollapsible %}

### Retrieve `rating-api` service hostname

{% collapsible %}

Find the `rating-api` service.

```sh
oc get svc rating-api
```

The service will be accessible at the following DNS name over port 8080: `rating-api.workshop.svc.cluster.local:8080` which is formed of `[service name].[project name].svc.cluster.local`. This resolves only within the cluster.

{% endcollapsible %}

### Update `rating-api` service pod port

{% collapsible %}
The rating-api pod itself runs on port 3000. You will need to update the SVC for the rating-api to listen on port 8080 and forward to port 3000 on the running pod.

Use this patch command to do that from the CLI
```sh
oc patch service/rating-api --patch '{"spec": {"ports": [{"name": "8080-tcp","protocol": "TCP", "port": 8080, "targetPort": 3000}]}}'
oc get svc rating-api

```
{% endcollapsible %}
### Setup GitHub webhook

To trigger S2I builds when you push code into your GitHib repo, you'll need to setup the GitHub webhook.

{% collapsible %}

Retrieve the GitHub webhook trigger secret. You'll need use this secret in the GitHub webhook URL.

```sh
oc get bc/rating-api -o=jsonpath='{.spec.triggers..github.secret}'
```

You'll get back something similar to the below. Make note the secret key in the red box as you'll need it in a few steps.

![Rating API GitHub trigger secret](media/rating-api-github-secret.png)

Retrieve the GitHub webhook trigger URL from the build configuration.

```sh
oc describe bc/rating-api
```

![Rating API GitHub trigger url](media/rating-api-github-webhook-url.png)

Replace the `<secret>` placeholder with the secret you retrieved in the previous step to have a URL similar to `https://api.otyvsnz3.eastus.aroapp.io:6443/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/workshop/buildconfigs/rating-api/webhooks/SECRETSTRING/github`. You'll use this URL to setup the webhook on your GitHub repository.

In your GitHub repository, select **Add Webhook** from **Settings** → **Webhooks**.

Paste the URL output (similar to above) into the Payload URL field.

Change the Content Type from GitHub’s default **application/x-www-form-urlencoded** to **application/json**.

Click **Add webhook**.

![GitHub add webhook](media/rating-api-github-addwebhook.png)

You should see a message from GitHub stating that your webhook was successfully configured.

Now, whenever you push a change to your GitHub repository, a new build will automatically start, and upon a successful build a new deployment will start.
