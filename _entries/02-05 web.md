The `mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web` is a NodeJS application that connects to the `mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-api`. Below are some of the details that you'll need to deploy this.

- `mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web` on GitHub: <https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web>
- The container exposes port 8080
- The web app connects to the API over the internal cluster DNS, using a proxy through an environment variable named `API`

### Fork the application to your own GitHub repository

To be able to setup CI/CD webhooks, you'll need to fork the application into your personal GitHub repository.

### Use the OpenShift CLI to deploy the `mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web`

> **Note** You're going to be using [source-to-image (S2I)](#source-to-image-s2i) as a build strategy.

{% collapsible %}

```sh
oc new-app https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web --strategy=source
```

![Create mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web using oc cli](media/oc-newapp-ratingweb.png)

{% endcollapsible %}

### Configure the required environment variables

{% collapsible %}

Create the `API` environment variable for `mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web` Deployment Config. The value of this variable is going to be the hostname/port of the `mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-api` service.

Instead of setting the environment variable through the Azure Red Hat OpenShift Web Console, you can set it through the OpenShift CLI.

```sh
oc set env deploy/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web API=http://mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-api:3000
```

{% endcollapsible %}

### Expose the `mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web` service using a Route

{% collapsible %}

Expose the service.

```sh
oc expose svc/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web
```

Find out the created route hostname

```sh
oc get route mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web
```

You should get a response similar to the below.

![Retrieve the created route](media/oc-get-route.png)

Notice the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is comprised of the application name and project name by default. The remainder of the FQDN, the subdomain, is your Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster specific apps subdomain.

{% endcollapsible %}

### Try the service

{% collapsible %}

Open the hostname in your browser, you should see the rating app page. Play around, submit a few votes and check the leaderboard.

### Setup GitHub webhook

To trigger S2I builds when you push code into your GitHib repo, you'll need to setup the GitHub webhook.

{% collapsible %}

Retrieve the GitHub webhook trigger secret. You'll need use this secret in the GitHub webhook URL.

```sh
oc get bc/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web -o=jsonpath='{.spec.triggers..github.secret}'
```

You'll get back something similar to the below. Make note the secret key in the red box as you'll need it in a few steps.

![Rating Web GitHub trigger secret](media/rating-web-github-secret.png)

Retrieve the GitHub webhook trigger URL from the build configuration.

```sh
oc describe bc/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web
```

![Rating Web GitHub trigger url](media/rating-web-github-webhook-url.png)

Replace the `<secret>` placeholder with the secret you retrieved in the previous step to have a URL similar to `https://openshift.9729df58f18c47bab789.eastus.azmosa.io:443/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/workshop/buildconfigs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web/webhooks/Dk5iK-HU8u6Ik1dFRKd4/github`. You'll use this URL to setup the webhook on your GitHub repository.

In your GitHub repository, select **Add Webhook** from **Settings** → **Webhooks**.

Paste the URL output (similar to above) into the Payload URL field.

Change the Content Type from GitHub’s default **application/x-www-form-urlencoded** to **application/json**.

Click **Add webhook**.

![GitHub add webhook](media/rating-web-github-addwebhook.png)

You should see a message from GitHub stating that your webhook was successfully configured.

Now, whenever you push a change to your GitHub repository, a new build will automatically start, and upon a successful build a new deployment will start.

{% endcollapsible %}

### Make a change to the website app and see the rolling update

{% collapsible %}

Go to the `https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web/blob/master/src/App.vue` file in your repository on GitHub.

Edit the file, and change the `background-color: #999;` line to be `background-color: #0071c5`.

Commit the changes to the file into the `master` branch.

![GitHub edit app](media/rating-web-editcolor.png)

Immediately, go to the **Builds** tab in the OpenShift Web Console. You'll see a new build queued up which was triggered by the push. Once this is done, it will trigger a new deployment and you should see the new website color updated.
