## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.  Most contributions require you to agree to a
Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us
the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.microsoft.com.

 Please fork and branch off `staging`, then submit a Pull Request against `staging`.
 If you want your name to show up in the [contributors](http://aroworkshop.io/#contributors), please add your GitHub username to `_entries/99 Contributors.md` in alphabetical order.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide
a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions
provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.
